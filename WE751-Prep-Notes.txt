As of June 2016, the environment that is used to support the IBM-supplied images
and DataPower gateways is Skytap.
Each student is supplied an Ubuntu student image and a DataPower gateway.
The supplied image is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. The desktop uses Unity, which is different
than the more common Gnome desktop.
Some hints on using Unity are at:
